== Software installation and configuration

Prior to getting started with image builder, the software must first be
installed. By installing the plugin for Web Console, all of the other
required packages will also be installed.

....
dnf install cockpit-composer -y
....

Type `+y+` to confirm the installation fo the software.

Now that the software is installed, restart the web console so that it
picks up the newly installed plugin for image builder.

....
systemctl restart cockpit
....
