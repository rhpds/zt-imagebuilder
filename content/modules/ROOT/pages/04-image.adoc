You are now ready to build your first image of this new Red Hat
Enterprise Linux build with Node.js and NGINX packages installed. Click
the _Create image_ button near the top of the interface.

.Create image

The resulting dialog will ask several questions about how to build the
image. The first, and most important question is _Type_. There are
several different output types supported by Image Builder: * Amazon Web
Services (.raw) * OpenStack (.qcow2) * QEMU Image (.qcow2) * RHEL for
Edge Commit (.tar) * RHEL for Edge Container (.tar) * RHEL for Edge
Installer (.iso) * Disk Archive (.tar) * Microsoft Azure (.vhd) * VMware
VSphere (.vmdk)

For this lab, select the _Type_ as *QEMU Image (.qcow2)* this makes a
virtual machine image that is compatible with the native virtualization
provided as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. However, you can see from
the list that you can make images for cloud providers or other
virtualization hypervisors.
