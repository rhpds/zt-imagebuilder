== Create a blueprint

Image Builder uses blueprints to create system images, however, none
exist on this system yet.

Select the _Create Blueprint_ button to start building your first
blueprint.

.Select Create Blueprint

The first step to creating a new blueprint is naming it. It is
recommended that you also include a description so that others using
this blueprint know what system image they are building. For this lab,
use *node-app-server* as the _Name_ and *A node.js and NGINX installed
web application server* as the _Description_.

.Name Your Blueprint

Click `+Next+`.

Next weâ€™ll customize the blueprint.

Add in the first package, `+nodejs+`, into the `+Available packages+`
search bar. Once the filter has been applied, you should now see
packages with `+nodejs+` included in their name. It might take a minute
or two for packages to load.

. Click on `+nodejs+`.
. Click the `+>+` symbol to add it.

Repeat these actions for the `+nginx+` package and then click `+Next+`.

Keep clicking the `+Next+` button until you reach the `+Other+` tab of
the customizations section within the blueprint creation dialog. As you
can see, image builder provides the ability to add custom kernel
parameters, add users, open firewall ports, and more.

Then, enter a hostname `+node-app-server+` for the image.
