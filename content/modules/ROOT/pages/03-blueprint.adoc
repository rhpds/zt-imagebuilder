== Introduction

Let's create an a qcow2 image blueprint for a node.js and NGINX installed web application server.

== Create a blueprint

Image Builder uses blueprints to create system images, however, none
exist on this system yet.

Select the _Create Blueprint_ button to start building your first
blueprint.

.Click Create Blueprint

=== Image Output

Let's specify the image output as a qcow2 file.

.Select qcow2

`+qcow2+` (QEMU Copy-On-Write version 2) is a disk image file format used in virtualization environments. `+qcow2+` is the primary format used with KVM virtualization which is the hypervisor used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

There are many optional customizations that can be made to the image. For the sake of brevity, advance the lab to the `+Additional packages+` menu by clicking `+Next+`.

=== Additional Packages






=== Name Your Blueprint







== Name Your Blueprint

The first step to creating a new blueprint is naming it. It is
recommended that you also include a description so that others using
this blueprint know what system image they are building. For this lab,
use *node-app-server* as the _Name_ and *A node.js and NGINX installed
web application server* as the _Description_.

.Name Your Blueprint

Click `+Next+`.

Next weâ€™ll customize the blueprint.

Add in the first package, `+nodejs+`, into the `+Available packages+`
search bar. Once the filter has been applied, you should now see
packages with `+nodejs+` included in their name. It might take a minute
or two for packages to load.

.add nodejs

. Click on `+nodejs+`.
. Click the `+>+` symbol to add it.

Repeat these actions for the `+nginx+` package and then click `+Next+`.

Keep clicking the `+Next+` button until you reach the `+Other+` tab of
the customizations section within the blueprint creation dialog. As you
can see, image builder provides the ability to add custom kernel
parameters, add users, open firewall ports, and more.

Then, enter a hostname `+node-app-server+` for the image.

Next, click `+Review+`
